# py2command
 py2command is a Minecraft command block wrapper for Python. It provides a simple way to write long command block chains while maintaining the ability to see multiple "command blocks" at once. It can also generate working NBT data for you, making it much easier to use correct syntax.
# Usage:
A pip package for py2command is coming soon, when the project is more developed.

If you would like to test py2command early, simply put the ```py2command.py``` file in the same folder as your command project, and import it! (it is recommended to import py2command like: ```import py2command as p2c``` to avoid typing as many characters).
